# Personal dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. In previous version I was using
`dotbot`. While it is a good tool and other tools similar to it are nice, but
it felt more like a burden. Now I am using a simple `git --bare` repository.

Most of the setup is taken from [this
article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).  Each branch of the
repo represents a machine and is named based on the hostname and a forward
slash annotates additional information.
